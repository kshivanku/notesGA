1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
um you know how do we learn from the old

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,750
and confront the new well I think the I

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:13,170
think we can draw many very good lessons

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,990
from the early period of the Industrial

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,550
Revolution of course earlier in England

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,600
but let's take care of the United States

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,359
the Industrial Revolution took off right

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,320
around here eastern Massachusetts mid

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:32,219
nineteenth century this was a period

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,390
when independent farmers were being

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,670
driven into the industrial system men

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,879
and women incidentally women from the

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,550
farms of gold factory girls and they

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,129
bitterly resented it they had it was a

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,410
period with very Free Press the most in

16
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,940
the in the history of the country there

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,520
was a wide variety of journals and the

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,390
ethnic labor others and when you read

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,129
them they're pretty fascinating the

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:06,799
people driven into the industrial system

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:10,020
regarded it is an attack on their

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,740
personal dignity on their rights as

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,229
human beings they were free human beings

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,530
who were being forced into what they

25
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,970
called wage slavery which they regarded

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,049
is not very different from chattel

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,090
slavery in fact this was such a popular

28
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:30,990
view that it was actually a slogan of

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,540
the Republican Party that the only

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,570
difference between working for a wage

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,670
and being a slave is that working for a

32
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,710
wage or supposedly temporary the

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,189
prisoner will be free other than that

34
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,549
they're not different and they bitterly

35
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,079
resented the fact that the the

36
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,860
industrial system was even taking away

37
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,680
their rich cultural life and the

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,180
cultural life was rich another by now

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,009
studies of the British working-class and

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,820
American working class and they were

41
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,209
part of high culture of the day Ike I

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,280
remember this is later the 1930s with my

43
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,709
own family industrial you know so

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,650
unemployed working-class and they said

45
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,770
this was being taken away from us we're

46
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,819
being forced to be something like slaves

47
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,970
they argued that if you if you're say a

48
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:31,080
journeyman craftsman and you sell your

49
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,870
product you're selling what you produced

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,690
if your wage if your wage earner you're

51
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,450
selling yourself which is deeply

52
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,930
offensive they condemned what they

53
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,930
called the new spirit of the age gained

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:52,019
wealth for getting old but self sounds

55
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:57,140
familiar and it was extremely radical it

56
00:02:52,019 --> 00:03:00,209
was combined with a the most radical

57
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,940
Democratic movement in American history

58
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:06,239
the populist the early populist movement

59
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,060
the radical farmers began in Texas

60
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,959
spreaded to the Midwest enormous

61
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,560
movement of farmers who wanted to free

62
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,329
themselves from the domination by the

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,850
northeastern bankers and capitalists

64
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,630
cousin ran the markets you know sort of

65
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:27,239
forced them to a silver what they

66
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,670
produced on credit and squeezed them

67
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,980
with credit and so on they went on to

68
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,709
develop their own banks to run

69
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,049
cooperatives they started to link up

70
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,920
with the Knights of Labor major labor

71
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,950
movement which held that as they put it

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,769
those those who work in the mills or

73
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,799
owned them that should be a Democrat

74
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:53,160
free democratic society these were very

75
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,190
powerful movements by the 1890s

76
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,140
you know workers were taking over towns

77
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,200
and running them in eastern Pennsylvania

78
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,299
and western Pennsylvania homesteads and

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,690
famous keys well they were crushed by

80
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,690
force
